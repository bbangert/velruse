VK - :mod:`velruse.providers.vk`
============================================

The VK (ex Vkontakte) provider authenticates using the OAuth 2.0
API with the VK API to obtain additional profile information
for use with user registration.

To use the VK authentication, you must register a VK application
for use with Velruse. You can do that by using the following links to learn about
and create said application.  Once you have done so, you will be supplied with a
consumer key and a consumer secret specific to VK.

Settings
--------
Whether you are using Velruse as a standalone app or as a Pyramid plugin, you will
need to add the following settings to an .ini file.  If you are using the standalone
app, you will need to add them to the .ini file that serves the standalone app.
If you are using Velruse as a Pyramid plugin, you will need to add them to your
Pyramid app's .ini file.

``consumer_key``
    VK Application ID
``consumer_secret``
