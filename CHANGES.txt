1.0 (2012-08-14)
================

Version 0.3 is classified as an older release than the previous 0.20
in the semantic versioning scheme. Thus 0.3 was a brownbag and 1.0 will
correct that issue.

This release is also an opportunity to promote Velruse's new API and
provide confidence that it will try to maintain backward compatibility
going forward.
